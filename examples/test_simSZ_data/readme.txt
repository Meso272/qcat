The two data file .int32 and .f32 in this directory were quantization bin array (int32) and unpredictable data (float32), generated by SZ 1.4 (using REL=0.01, i.e., abs error bound = 0.0471032, based on the sample data file testfloat_8_8_128.dat).

Its compression ratio is 55.072 and PSNR=47.36.

./simSZ gives very similar compression ratio 56.98.
Max Error = 0.003918 means that the maximum compression error for the unpredictable data is 0.003918, which is smaller than the specified absolute error bound 0.0471.
So, the result is correct.

Note that the simSZ's CR is slightly higher than the original SZ's compression ratio, which is reasonable, because the original SZ also includes a small amount of metadata in the header of compressed bytes. This metadata overhead is negligible for large dataset (such as Hurricane, Miranda), unlike the relatively small sample dataset testfloat_8_8_128.dat.
